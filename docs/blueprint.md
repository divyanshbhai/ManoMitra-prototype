## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#90AFC5) to promote calmness and trust, reflecting the platform's supportive environment. It steers clear of overly stimulating colors to maintain a peaceful user experience.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F8), providing a neutral and clean backdrop that reduces eye strain and emphasizes content.
- Accent color: Muted green (#A9D18E) to highlight interactive elements and calls to action, creating a gentle sense of encouragement.  
- Body and headline font: 'Mukta' (sans-serif) providing excellent readability and reflecting the app's Indian context. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use `lucide-react` to ensure icons are consistent, modern, and clear, enhancing visual communication without being overwhelming.
- A clean, intuitive layout with a collapsible sidebar for easy navigation. Prioritize content hierarchy to guide users effectively.
- Subtle, gentle animations (e.g., fades, slides) to enhance user engagement without causing distraction. Animations should be used sparingly to maintain a focus on content and support a sense of calm.
